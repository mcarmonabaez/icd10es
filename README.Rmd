## Package description

`icd10es` is an R package created for :es: Spanish-speaking Bioinformatics specialist who have to deal with classifying written descriptions of diseases, symptoms, and injuries, among other health-related issues, in the 10th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10 for short), referred to as CIE-10 in Spanish.

## Installing icd10es 

```{r, eval =FALSE, message=FALSE, warning =FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mcarmonabaez/icd10es")
```

*Congratulations!* Now you can use this package! 🎉

## Features at a glance

### Printing information of a CIE-10 entry

:female-doctor:

Let's start with a simple task: say you wish to know what the entry 'A00.0' in the catalog contains.
The function `printInfo` can help with that. Changing the value of the parameter `tabular` you
can decide whether you want to 

- get only the canonical term in table form, 

- get the canonical and all inclusion terms (if they exist) also in table form, 

- print in all associated information in the console for quick inquiries.

```{r}
library(icd10es)
printInfo('S72.1', tabular = 'single')
printInfo('S72.1', tabular = 'simple')
printInfo('S72.1', tabular = 'full')
```




### Looking up a string in the catalog

The main function of `icd10es` consists in entering a string which is expected to match some entry in the CIE-10 and finding said entry, all via the `ICDLookUp` function. The string does not have to be identical to the entry: herein lies the usefulness of the package.

The function first tries to find an __exact__ match in the catalog, but often it occurs that the string either has a typo of some kind (e.g. writing 'pnuemonia' instead of 'pneumonia) or uses a more colloquial way of referring to the disease or symptom and is not its 'full name'. When this happens, the function tries fuzzy matching using the Jaro-Winkler similarity metric. 

For example, in the CIE-10, all cancers are referred to in a more formal way, such as 'tumor maligno del colon' instead of 'cancer de colon' (in English: 'malignant neoplasm of colon' instead of 'colon cancer'). `ICDLookUp` would give the following output:

```{r}
ICDLookUp('cancer de colon', tabular = 'simple')
```
Note how the `tabular` parameter is inherited to `printInfo`.

When doing fuzzy matching, one can be more or less strict. 
This is reflected in the `jwBound` parameter of `ICDLookUp`: the Jaro-Winkler
similarity goes from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (exact match), and the default value of
`jwBound` is 0.9. That is, only entries with a similarity to the entered string equal
or higher than 0.9 will be considered. But if one finds that the function didn't find a
result, one can try lowering the bound:

```{r}
ICDLookUp('sindrome dandie-waker', jwBound = 0.9, tabular = 'simple')
ICDLookUp('sindrome dandie-waker', jwBound = 0.8, tabular = 'simple')
```




😷

### Using an external catalog

It can happen that the user wants to look up strings in a different,
specialized catalog. This could be for example when using an auxiliary catalog
which has alternative names of some diseases due to regional variations
(like when a country or a country's province historically calls a disease in a special way).

This can be done by making the `ICDLookUp` parameter `useExternal = TRUE`,
and by giving a `dataframe` to `externalCatalog`:

```{r}
auxCatalog <- read.delim('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcarmonabaez/icd10es/master/inst/extdata/inputs/diabetes_subcategories.csv')
ICDLookUp('Diabetes tipo i con coma', tabular = 'simple',
          useExternal = TRUE, externalCatalog = auxCatalog)
```

### Looking up entries within death certificates
