This vignette compares dplyr functions to their base R equivalents. This helps those familiar with base R understand better what dplyr does, and shows dplyr users how you might express the same ideas in base R code. We'll start with a rough overview of the major differences, then discuss the one table verbs in more detail, followed by the two table verbs.

# Overview

    R functions which more frequently work with individual vectors.
