## Features at a glance

### Printing information of a CIE-10 entry

## Printing information of a CIE-10 entry
Let's start with a simple task: say you wish to know what the entry 'A00.0' in the catalog contains.
The function `printInfo` can help with that. Changing the value of the parameter `tabular` you
can decide whether you want to 

- get only the canonical term in table form, 

- get the canonical and all inclusion terms (if they exist) also in table form, 

- print in all associated information in the console for quick inquiries.

```{r}
library(icd10es)
printInfo('S72.1', tabular = 'single')
printInfo('S72.1', tabular = 'simple')
printInfo('S72.1', tabular = 'full')
```
